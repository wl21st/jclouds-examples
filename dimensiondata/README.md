## Environment

To set up an environment to compile and run the examples use these commands:

Every example class has a main method that takes the following arguments in the listed order:

1. API Endpoint
1. Username
1. Password

If there are other arguments required, they will follow. The command line format looks like this:
```
java -cp target\dimensiondata-cloudcontrol-examples-<VERSION>-jar-with-dependencies.jar <MAIN_CLASS> apiEndpoint username password <PARAMETERS>
```

Try out an example.

```
java -cp target\dimensiondata-cloudcontrol-examples-<VERSION>-jar-with-dependencies.jar org.jclouds.examples.dimensiondata.cloudcontrol.DeployNetworkDomainVlanAndServer apiEndpoint username password
